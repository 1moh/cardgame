# Thoughts

Just random that are not necessarily ordered.

## Rank / Level

Players should be able to play ranked and normal games. Being able to play ranked
and be rewarded with a rank, is something that gives players the motivation to
play and improve.

Level would be aside from rank and basically just display your general game
experience. Both ranked and normal games would reward with level ups.

Ranked games should only be able playable after either finishing certain tutorials
or reaching a certain level, which would mean having a certain level of understanding.

## Puzzles

This would be a cool mode to play casually. A player would be presented with a
pre-defined field of cards, including field-zones, hand, deck and graveyard, for
both the enemy and themself. The goal is basically to win the game given the presented
situation. Other games have such modes too. An example would be Yu-Gi-Oh (DevPro), Chess
and Hearthstone.

## Guest Login

Sometimes people just want to try out a game and therefore not create an account.
A new account always means new credentials or even a new service that could potentially
leak your data that you keep reusing (shame on you).

The guest login will not allow setting a custom username, but instead autogenerate a
so called "petname". This would be something along the lines of "EagerlyBigEagle".

These guest logins wouldn't allow you to gain XP, a rank, play ganked, have friends or
even create decks. Decks would be default pre-sets and MAYBE even temporarily imported
decks.

Invites would work via the friends list. The friends list would still be there for
guests, so that they can invite other guests as well.
