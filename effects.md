# Card ideas

## Special effect types

Contract

> A contract is an effect, that after a certain thing has been done, will grant
> you a certain reward. This could for example be summoning 3 warriors in one
> round or dealing direct damage to the enemy two rounds in a row.
> 
> Contracts would work as an active spell effect or a passive warrior effect.

Buff adjacent slots

> This would simply be a buff that empowers warriors in a certain range of slots.

Global buffs

> Apply buff to everything on field, optionally having conditions.

Own field buffs

> Apply buff to own field, optionally having conditions.

Luck-based (Coin toss / dice roll):

> These effects would be rather strong, but also have a strong downside.

Mana manipulation

> Cards could be able to remove mana, steal mana or add mana. This can as well
> be combined with other effects.

Lifepoints manipulation

> Directly add or subtract lifepoint to either players lifepoints.

Passive effects

> General passive effects could alter the behaviour of cards. For example could
> a card not be attackable til it attacked. This could be interesting on a
> warrior that has low defense and therefore be played in offense.

Place condition

> Warriors might have multiple effects of which certain might be blocked
> depending on how the monster was placed.

Taunt

> Taunt will only allow attacking certain warriors. Multiple taunts will
> allow you to chose.

One time immunity

> Immune against next equipmentcard, effect or damage. Damage is fully
> anulated and doesn't affect lifepoints.

Card insight

> Reveal hand cards or placed cards

Effect steal

> Effect steal will take the effect of something and give it to something else.

Effect silence

> Single target effect silence.

Blacksmith

> Buffing equipment.

Durability manipulation

> Durability increase or decrease instant or by attacking or so.

Tokens

> Dummy monsters with null stats.

Place / Draw from deck

> Places a warrior from deck optionally with condition. Could be combined with
> contract.

Turn skip + strong effect

> Optionally skip your next turn in order to be able to gain something to help
> you make a comeback.

Graveyard effects

> Damage / Heal according to graveyard content or retrieve card from graveyard.

Tribute summon

> Either require a certain type of tribute(s) or optional tribute with mana cost
> reduction. Tribute in order to prevent automatic death at end of turn.

Negative effects

> Some monsters might have negative effects as a payoff.
